Even one image is too large to upload, so please go to the Google-drive, and download the rar file, which name is "data" <br>

Because running the entire program (final_吳承霖.ipynb) takes more than 10 minutes, if teacher prefers not to execute and wait it, you can directly run the "lazy.ipynb" file.
The "lazy.ipynb" program will load two txt files and plot, those txt files data are obtained from image analysis (analysis from final_吳承霖.ipynb).

Happy new year!
